Polyjuice Potion transforms the person who drinks it into the physical form of another person for up to an hour. Harry, Hermione, and Ron swap out their Butterbeer beverages for three steaming goblets of Polyjuice Potion as they plot to trick Draco Malfoy into revealing whether or not he is the heir of Slytherin.

However, Hermione discovers that Polyjuice Potion has quite a few complexities when she accidentally mixes a stray cat hair into the concoction, which triggers her transformation into a cat-human hybrid, complete with furry ears and a fluffy tail.

One wrong move and you could be facing a whole lot of toil and trouble.

It is mostly used for spying purpose. 

Greate concept and huge success!! :)
