Polyjuice Potion transforms the person who drinks it into the physical form of another person for up to an hour. Harry, Hermione, and Ron swap out their Butterbeer beverages for three steaming goblets of Polyjuice Potion as they plot to trick Draco Malfoy into revealing whether or not he is the heir of Slytherin.

However, Hermione discovers that Polyjuice Potion has quite a few complexities when she accidentally mixes a stray cat hair into the concoction, which triggers her transformation into a cat-human hybrid, complete with furry ears and a fluffy tail.

One wrong move and you could be facing a whole lot of toil and trouble.

It is mostly used for spying purpose. 

Greate concept and huge success!! :)

The Polyjuice Potion, which is a complex and time-consuming concoction, is best left to highly skilled witches and wizards. It enables the consumer to assume the physical appearance of another person, as long as they have first procured part of that individual's body to add to the brew (this may be anything — toenail clippings, dandruff or worse — but it is most usual to use hair). 
The idea that a witch or wizard might make evil use of parts of the body is an ancient one, and exists in the folklore and superstitions of many cultures. The effect of the potion is only temporary,
and depending on how well it has been brewed, may last anything from between ten minutes and twelve hours. 
You can change age, sex, and race by taking the Polyjuice Potion, but not species."

ok
