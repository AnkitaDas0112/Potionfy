Nature
"Powerful infatuations can be induced by the skilful potioneer, but never yet has anyone managed to create the truly unbreakable, eternal, unconditional attachment that alone can be called Love."

Amortentia was the most powerful love potion in existence. 
It was considered to be a powerful and highly dangerous potion. 
As stated, it was dangerous to underestimate a powerful infatuation. 
Despite its power, Amortentia did not create actual love; as it was impossible to manufacture or imitate love.
The person under the effect of the potion would only hold an obsession for the person who administered it.
